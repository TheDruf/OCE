 # OCE Framework Overview

### The OCE Framework is designed to provide a standardized approach to collaboration that can be adapted for different types of projects. The framework is based on the following key principles:
## Governance

Collaborators should work together to establish clear governance structures for their project, including decision-making processes and guidelines for resolving conflicts.
## Contribution Guidelines

Contributors should adhere to a set of guidelines that outline their roles and responsibilities, as well as expectations for conduct and communication.
## Licensing



Projects should be licensed under the Open Collab Entity (OCE) License, which allows for both commercial and non-commercial use of the licensed material, as long as proper attribution is given and any modifications are clearly indicated. The OCE License also allows for others to create their own licenses based on the OCE License for their unique needs, as long as they are submitted for review and approval.

## Attribution

All works derived from the original OCE project must include the original title with Druf added to the end of the title, as well as proper attribution to the original creators and the OCE License. This attribution should include all predecessor contributors if any, so that their contributions are properly recognized and acknowledged. By providing clear attribution, collaborators can promote a culture of open collaboration and encourage future contributions to the project.


## Decentralized Storage Networks

Projects should be stored on decentralized storage networks that allow for secure and efficient sharing and collaboration.
## Smart Contract Platforms

Smart contract platforms can be used to facilitate collaboration and enforce the terms of the OCE License. Smart contracts can also be used to distribute ownership and revenue sharing among collaborators.

The OCE Framework is designed to provide a comprehensive set of guidelines and best practices for collaboration on projects using the Open Collab Entity License. By adhering to these principles, collaborators can work together to create innovative and creative projects while also protecting the rights of creators and collaborators.
